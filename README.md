## 📝 History of name

The word "_Fiber_" comes from "_Fiber optic cable_". 

> A fiber optic cable is a network cable that contains strands of glass fibers inside an insulated casing. They're designed for long distance, high-performance data networking, and telecommunications. Compared to wired cables, fiber optic cables provide higher bandwidth and can transmit data over longer distances.
